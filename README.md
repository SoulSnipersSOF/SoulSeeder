# SoulSeeder

**Developed by SoulSniper** for the SoulSniper Gaming community.

SoulSeeder is a small Windows utility that helps **seed Hell Let Loose servers automatically**. It launches HLL on a schedule, auto-joins your configured servers, and then exits. On shutdown, it can **silently auto-update** itself so you’re always on the latest version without interrupting your morning seeding.
